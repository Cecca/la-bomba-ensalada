La Bomba
========

This is a transcription of "La Bomba", an ensalada by Mateo Flecha el Viejo.

Engraving is done with [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) and
[OpenLilyLib](https://github.com/openlilylib/openlilylib).

Source
------

I could not find the original source, hence I am using
[a score](http://www3.cpdl.org/wiki/images/9/9e/605.pdf) available at CPDL as
source.

Compiling
---------

You need to have [OpenLilyLib](https://github.com/openlilylib/openlilylib)
installed somewhere. Suppose that you installed it in `~/.openlilylib`, then the
command to compile the main score is

```
liliypond -I ~/.openlilylib -I ~/.openlilylib/ly main.ly
```
